AI

Concept
  List<Link> links
  /*
  TODO should there be a name or something like that for a concept?
  Probably best if there isn't, since concepts could be very abstract and the idea is that they form themselves.

Link
  Concept destination
  double strength [0,1]



Input and output are both character streams over time
Feedback can be an additional input [-1,1]


The AI should probably have a goal.
The goal could be to maximize a happiness score for example. That score always levels out over time.





What if you have an Actor system where each neuron is an Actor.
Neuron implements Target
  double value [0,1]
  Set<Link> links

Link
  Target destination
  double strength [-1,1]
  double delay [0,1]

Input
  char c
  Neuron n

Output implements Target
  char c

AI
  List<Input> inputs
  List<Output> outputs

On input fire the corresponding inputs.
Initially we probably need a set of neurons with paths from inputs to outputs. Maybe "nothing" should also be an input so we have a constant stream of activity.

We need a way to change strenths and delays of links.
We probably also need a way to add new Neurons and Links.
